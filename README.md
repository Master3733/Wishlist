## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. I had trouble using the EditTexts when it came down to running the app itself. I learned that 
I needed three EditTexts in one xml file and three TextViews in another xml file.
2. I struggled a little bit trying to figure out how to make the button's fucntionality.
3. I did not quite understand how to use the three necessary functions for a RecyclerView.
